This program creates team batting statistics for every baseball team in 
history using the [lahman baseball database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/).
The program stores the data in the table *TeamCareerBatting*.
Use the file *TeamCareerBatting.sql* in the root directory to create the
table.

Team career batting statistics are defined as the total number of the 
statistic  at the start of the year for every player who played on that team 
during the given year.  For example, to calculate the team career hits for the 
[2007 New York Mets](http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYM/2007.shtml)
take every player who played on the Mets in 2007 and add up their
total career hits prior to the start of the 2007 season.
